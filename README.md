# L-layer Neural Network Model using Gradient Descent Algorithm from Scratch
This project is an implementation of an L-layer Neural Network using the Gradient Descent Algorithm from scratch. The aim of this project is to build a basic understanding of the fundamentals of Neural Networks and how to build them using gradient descent algorithm. The model is then used to predict on dogs-vs-cats dataset.

The network is trained using gradient descent algorithm with backpropagation which is also implemented from scratch. The sample dataset is loaded and preprocessed before being used for training and testing the network.

## Acknowledgments:
This project is inspired by the amazing work of Andrew Ng in his course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning".
